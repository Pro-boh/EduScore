## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. Please follow the steps below to ensure that your report is handled securely and efficiently:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly:** Do not open a public issue or post details about the vulnerability in public forums. Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it is properly addressed could put the project and its users at risk.

2. **Contact Us:** Send an email to [prabodha.stu@gmail.com](mailto:prabodha.stu@gmail.com) with the details of the vulnerability. Please include the following information:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any relevant proof of concept (PoC) code.
   - Potential impact or exploitability of the vulnerability.

3. **Response Time:** We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 48 hours. You will receive an acknowledgment of your report and, if necessary, we may request additional information to help us understand and address the issue.

4. **Fix and Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is verified, we will work on a fix and release it as soon as possible. We will coordinate with you to determine the best timing for public disclosure of the vulnerability.

5. **Recognition:** If you report a valid vulnerability, we are happy to publicly acknowledge your contribution in the release notes or a dedicated "Security" section of our documentation (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
