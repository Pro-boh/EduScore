This software was developed using the C programming language under the careful inspection of a group of three developers. 
The team employed an **iterative development method**, where each phase of the software was developed, reviewed, and refined incrementally. 
Throughout the process, individual components were integrated progressively, with thorough testing and adjustments made at each stage. 
This approach ensured a seamless final integration, resulting in a robust and efficient software product.
This GPA calculation software allows users to choose between two optional paths of a selected degree. 
The end user must manually input the grade for each course, with the course codes displayed on the screen. 
The software reads these course codes from two text files and presents them to the user. 
GPA calculation is performed by comparing the user-inputted grades using the `strcmp` function, assigning grade values from a predefined array.
The entire software operates through a command-line interface (CLI) and is developed in C.
